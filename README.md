### CS229 - Machine Learning Side Projects
#These are a number of projects that I did parallel to the theoretical Stanford CS229 class.

## Heartfailure
The heart failure file is based on [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) in Kaggle. It contains the regular classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Random Forest, support vector machines and etc.

## Digit Recogniser
A very simple digit recogniser program - suitable for learning Tenserflow basics. It is based on the famous [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).
